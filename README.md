I have used Gatsby to create my website using Javascript and React. 

My website can be deployed via Gatsby cloud or by downloading all the files, you can type gatsby develop in the terminal and see a local host of the website. 

I have used the 'dayjs' library for the live countdown in order for it to be accurate.
